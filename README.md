## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Neural Audio Analysis
Our proprietary algorithms analyze the sonic texture of your top tracks, evaluating metrics such as:
*   **Harmonic Complexity**: Measuring the sophistication of chord progressions.
*   **Lyrical Density**: Analyzing vocabulary range and thematic depth.
*   **Rhythmic Diversity**: Evaluating time signature variance and syncopation.

### 🌐 Multi-Platform Integration
Seamlessly connects with major streaming services to retrieve your raw listening data:
*   **Spotify** (Deep Integration)
*   **Apple Music** (Secure OAuth)
*   **YouTube Music** (History Parsing)

### 📝 Psychometric Profiling
The analysis doesn't stop at data. Our **Adaptive Quiz Engine** challenges your perceived taste through three distinct phases:
1.  **Validation**: Establishing baseline preferences.
2.  **Doubt**: Challenging your "guilty pleasures".
3.  **Roast**: The AI takes the gloves off.

### 🏆 Official Certification
Upon completion, receive a verified **MusicIQ Certificate**:
*   **Downloadable PDF**: High-resolution official document.
*   **Shareable Assets**: Optimized images for social media flexing.
*   **Detailed Breakdown**: Visual graphs of your taste profile.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**MusicIQ** is a satirical application designed for entertainment purposes. While it *does* use your actual listening data (when available) to generate questions and insights, the "IQ Score" and "Neural Analysis" are simulated for comedic effect. Please do not take the "Roast" phase personally—our AI is just programmed to be snarky. 😉
